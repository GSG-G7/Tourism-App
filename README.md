We divide our project to two-stages :

## First Stage :
 Done by :
- Hashem Taha

Country API : The Country API returns basic information on all of the countries in the world.
- This API is completely free and open-source and doesn't require any form of uthentication, and there are no request limits.
- You should add [Moesif CORS] extention to chrome browser, because [Access to XMLHttpRequest at url of Country-API from a nother origin  has been blocked by CORS policy] 

<b>Process :</b> 
- Requestt Country-API and implemented it successfully with the required data that we request form the server.
- Make test for Functions, then the tests are passed
- Make functions
- We got the required data from the server.
